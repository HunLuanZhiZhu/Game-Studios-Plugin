# Active Hooks

Hooks are registered by this plugin in `hooks/hooks.json` and fire whenever the plugin is installed and enabled. Workspace host settings live at `.zcode/settings.json` (ZCode) and `.claude/settings.json` (Claude Code); they carry status-line and permission settings only — hook registration lives in `hooks/hooks.json`.

| Hook | Event | Trigger | Action |
| ---- | ----- | ------- | ------ |
| `validate-commit.sh` | PreToolUse (Bash) | `git commit` commands | Validates design doc sections, JSON data files, hardcoded values, TODO format |
| `validate-push.sh` | PreToolUse (Bash) | `git push` commands | Warns on pushes to protected branches (develop/main) |
| `validate-assets.sh` | PostToolUse (Write/Edit) | Asset file changes | Checks naming conventions and JSON validity for files in `assets/` |
| `session-start.sh` | SessionStart | Session begins | Loads sprint context, milestone, git activity; detects and previews active session state file for recovery |
| `detect-gaps.sh` | SessionStart | Session begins | Detects fresh projects (suggests /start) and missing documentation when code/prototypes exist, suggests /reverse-document or /project-stage-detect |
| `pre-compact.sh` | PreCompact | Context compression | Dumps session state (active.md, modified files, WIP design docs) into conversation before compaction so it survives summarization |
| `post-compact.sh` | PostCompact | After compaction | Reminds Claude to restore session state from `active.md` checkpoint |
| `notify.sh` | Notification | Notification event | Shows Windows toast notification via PowerShell |
| `session-stop.sh` | Stop | Session ends | Summarizes accomplishments and updates session log |
| `log-agent.sh` | SubagentStart | Agent spawned | Audit trail start — logs subagent invocation with timestamp |
| `log-agent-stop.sh` | SubagentStop | Agent stops | Audit trail stop — completes subagent record |
| `validate-skill-change.sh` | PostToolUse (Write/Edit) | Skill file changes | Advises running `/skill-test` after any `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/` file is written or edited |
